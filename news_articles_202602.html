Temporary residents shouldn't receive full benefits, says Alberta premier  <br>
CBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Alberta Premier Danielle Smith on Friday defended proposals to limit government benefits to non-permanent residents in the province.
Smith wants to put immigration measures and constitutional questions to Albertans via a referendum that will be held on Oct. 19.
During a news conference Friday, one day after her video address to Albertans, she reiterated that the costs of benefits like health care, education and social services are a strain on government coffers.
Proposed referendum questions include asking Albertans about creating premiums and residency requirements for non-permanent residents to access social supports, and the province exerting greater control over immigration, prioritizing economic migrants. 

Earlier Friday, the Alberta Opposition NDP said the provincial government should simply call a general election, rather than hold a fall referendum that will include at least nine questions to Albertans.
"The only thing that's clear is that those nine questions are intended to be a distraction from the premier about to table a very bad budget for Albertans," NDP deputy leader Rakhi Pancholi said.
In her video address, Smith foreshadows the 2026 provincial budget, which is to be tabled next week and is expected to have a multibillion-dollar deficit. Smith said the province's financial situation is due to low oil prices, federal immigration policies and equalization payments. 

"They don't have a mandate from Albertans for this. Not on separatism, not on pulling out of the CPP, not on breaching the charter rights of thousands of Albertans, not on coal mining in the eastern slopes, and not on two-tier health-care," Pancholi said.
Pancholi called the premier's comments on immigration hypocritical, citing UCP's "Alberta is Calling campaign," designed to attract skilled workers from other provinces.

Toronto police officers accused of GPS tracking victim, orchestrating insurance fraud: court docs  <br>

Toronto Police Service Chief Myron Demkiw leaves after speaking about ‘Project South,’ an investigation into organized crime and corruption involving police and others, at York Regional Police headquarters in Aurora, Ont., on Feb. 5, 2026. 
Seven Toronto police officers, one retired officer and 19 civilians are facing charges after an investigation into organized crime. Police say the investigation includes a conspiracy to commit murder, shootings, extortion, robbery, drug trafficking and firearms offences. 
Last week, several police officers from Toronto were charged in a corruption probe. Three officers from the Peel region were later suspended in connection. Ontario's inspector general of policing has announced all 45 police forces in the province — and their boards — will be reviewed by an external investigator, with the findings to be made public. 

Newly released court documents reveal more details about charges laid against multiple Toronto police officers in a sweeping corruption probe — including allegations that an officer helped place a GPS tracker on a victim’s vehicle so another person could follow her.
That’s on top of accusations that a different officer arranged to have another person’s vehicle stolen so he could then file a false insurance claim. 
Seven active Toronto police officers and one retired officer have been charged in connection with the case, which has resulted in numerous charges including conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking. 

The documents also reveal more information about the Crown’s case against 29-year-old Const. John Madeley Jr. — who is still with Toronto police — and his father, retired constable John Madeley Sr., 55. 
The court filings say that between the beginning of 2024 up until the end of January 2026, the younger Madeley conducted “unlawful queries of police databases” and provided information to people who weren’t police officers.
That’s on top of using Toronto police’s computer systems with “intent to commit an Offence” over that same time period, according to the documents.
Court filings allege Madeley Sr. also accessed Toronto police systems in the same way as his son over that same time period — though he retired in April 2025.

Trump responds to Supreme Court loss with new 10% tariff, leaving Canada to wait for fine print  <br>
CBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
In a 6-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has found that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in imposing tariffs when he invoked emergency presidential powers to bring the levies into effect last year. 
Trump also took a shot at Canada and the country's auto sector in his remarks. He said the country "ripped us off for 30 per cent of our market" and claimed that Mexico has ripped the U.S. off, too.
Auto, steel and aluminum tariffs have been the most damaging to Canada's economy. Those all remain in place.
CBC News is trying to clarify if CUSMA-compliant goods will be exempt from Trump's new global tariff.

MacKinnon sends Canada to gold-medal game after sinking Finns with game winner in dying seconds  <br>

Joshua Clipperton  <br>
Nathan MacKinnon's goal with 36 seconds left in the game gave Canada a 3-2 victory over Finland, allowing them to reach the Olympic men's hockey gold-medal game. 

Sam Reinhart and Shea Theodore had the other goals for Canada, which will face either the United States or Slovakia in Sunday's podium decider to cap the NHL's return to the Games. Jordan Binnington made 15 saves.
Connor McDavid picked up two assists to set the record for points by an NHL player at a single Olympics with 13.
Mikko Rantanen and Erik Haula replied for Finland. Juuse Saros stopped 36 shots. The Finns will take on the loser of U.S.-Slovakia in Friday's late semifinal for bronze on Saturday. 

Canada was minus captain Sidney Crosby after he suffered a lower-body injury in the second period of Wednesday's thrilling 4-3 overtime victory. The 38-year-old's right leg bent in an awkward direction as he braced for a hit from defenceman Radko Gudas near centre ice.
Canadian head coach Jon Cooper said Crosby's status for Sunday's gold-medal game remains uncertain.

How Eric Dane gave his final months to 'moving the needle' on ALS  <br>
BBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Maia Davies  <br>
Dane was best known for appearing in more than 100 episodes of hospital drama Grey's Anatomy as Dr Mark Sloan, or "Dr McSteamy". 

Eric Dane, best known for starring in Grey's Anatomy, has died 10 months after confirming he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
The actor spent his final months raising funds and awareness for the rare, incurable condition - the most common form of motor-neurone disease (MND), which causes a progressive paralysis of the muscles. 
The 53-year-old shared in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with the debilitating and painful condition.
It causes the loss of cells which control voluntary muscle movements and, eventually, patients lose their ability to speak, eat, walk and breathe independently.
He helped to launch a three-year campaign in September aiming to raise more than $1bn (£742,000) in federal funding for research.

Government considers removing Andrew from royal line of succession  <br>
BBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Richard Wheeler  <br>
The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.
Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the "right thing to do," regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.
Currently Andrew, the King's brother, remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including "prince", last October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
On Thursday evening, Andrew was released under investigation 11 hours after his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. 

At one point more than 20 vehicles could be seen parked at the property, although it is not known it all was connected to the investigation and searches.
Thames Valley Police, the force which arrested him, is expected to continue searching Royal Lodge until Monday, the BBC understands.
The government's proposal comes after some MPs, including the Liberal Democrats and SNP, signalled their support for such legislation.
Some Labour parliamentarians who have been critical of the monarchy told the BBC they were less convinced the move was required - in part because it is so unlikely the former Duke of York would ever get near to the throne.

Mountbatten-Windsor stepped back from public duties in 2019 following a backlash after an interview with BBC Newsnight about his relationship with Epstein.
Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said "all of us in public life need to give space" to the police investigation to be carried out.

Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the Moon  <br>
BBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Greg Brosnan  <br>
Nasa is targeting early March to launch a crew around the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, in what would be humankind's furthest trip into space.
The Artemis II mission will see four astronauts embark on a 10-day journey around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth, paving the way for a future lunar landing.
Nasa set the earliest launch date of March 6 (early on March 7 in the UK) following a successful "wet dress rehearsal" - a critical pre-launch test where the rocket is filled with fuel and taken through the countdown sequence. 

The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.
Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.

Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.
Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.
They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.
It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.
The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.
The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.

The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface.
The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.
Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.
Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.
Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.
As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.

The US could strike Iran. Here’s how Tehran is getting prepared  <br>

A member of the Iranian Army attends a joint naval exercise between Iran and Russia in southern Iran in this handout image obtained by Reuters on February 19. 

As the United States continues a significant military buildup in the Middle East, Iran has taken steps to signal its readiness for war, including fortifying its nuclear sites and rebuilding missile production facilities. 
Despite ongoing talks, the White House has been briefed that the US military could be ready for an attack by the weekend, after a buildup in recent days of air and naval assets in the Middle East, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
Amid the threat of war, Iran has spent recent months repairing key missile facilities and heavily damaged air bases while further concealing its nuclear program. It has appointed war veterans to its national security structures, conducted maritime wargames in the Persian Gulf and launched an intense crackdown on domestic dissent.

In June last year, Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran that destroyed parts of its nuclear program, severely damaged missile production sites and killed key military commanders. Over the ensuing 12-day conflict, Iran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israeli cities, while the US struck three Iranian nuclear sites – with US President Donald Trump claiming they had been “totally obliterated.” 
Despite suffering heavy losses in the war with Israel, satellite imagery analysis reveals that Iran has rebuilt damaged missile facilities. 

Despite expressing flexibility in limiting its nuclear program, Iran is rapidly fortifying several of its nuclear facilities, using concrete and large amounts of soil to bury key sites, according to new satellite imagery and analysis from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS). 
At a nuclear facility known as ‘Taleghan 2’ at the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran, satellite images published this week show that Iran has completed a concrete sarcophagus around the site and is now covering it with soil, according to the Washington-based institute that focuses on nuclear nonproliferation.

Tehran has since strengthened the Supreme National Security Council headed by Khamenei confidant Ali Larijani and formed a new authority – the Defense Council – to govern in times of war.
War veteran and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Ali Shamkhani, who survived an Israeli attempt on his life during last year’s war, was appointed this month as the secretary of the Defense Council, with the aim of “comprehensively strengthening defense preparations” and developing “mechanisms to counter emerging threats,” an outlet affiliated with Iran’s security apparatus, Nour News, said. 

Israel’s strikes on Iran in June were preceded by a sophisticated infiltration by Israel’s Mossad spy agency, a tactic that heightened the already paranoid state of the Iranian regime. 
And the regime’s deepening paranoia has even turned inward. Last week, four prominent reformists who campaigned for President Masoud Pezeshkian were detained by Iranian security forces and accused of incitement against “the internal atmosphere” and working “to destroy national cohesion by … spreading untrue positions against the country,”

Who are Donald Trump's 'kindred spirits' in Europe?  <br>
DW News  <br>
Feb 19, 2026  <br>
Christoph Hasselbach  <br>
US President Donald Trump has many enthusiastic supporters in Europe — but his plans to take over Greenland have cost him some fans. US President Donald Trump has long been able to count on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. 

Viktor Orban has been in office since 2015 and was already in power during Trump's first term (2017-2021). He sees him as a kindred spirit and in the past even referred to him as a "twin" brother. While Trump's predecessor Joe Biden said that Orban was "looking for dictatorship," the current US president has called him a "true friend, fighter and winner." 
Orban has supported Trump's plans to reduce or even stop US military aid to Ukraine, in contrast to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He has also refused to criticize Russia's war in Ukraine and has no qualms about meeting President Vladimir Putin. The Hungarian prime minister is an outsider in the European Union (EU). He has a good relationship with Germany's far-right AfD party, whose leader Alice Weidel he hosted last year. In his speech, he called her "the future of Germany." 

Slovakia: Prime Minster Fico is a contradictory figure. 
Trump sees Fico as one of his most important partners in Europe alongside Orban. The Slovakian prime minister is particularly anti-immigration and in 2016 said that "Islam has no place in Slovakia." 
But Fico's approach towards the United States has been contradictory. During his first term (2006 to 2010), he established close ties with Russia, China, Venezuela and Cuba. In late January, an article in the magazine Politico drew attention when it reported that some unnamed European diplomats had said Fico had expressed concern about the president's "psychological state" on the sidelines of a summit in Brussels.

India's AI governance push takes center stage at summit  <br>
DW News  <br>

India hosted tens of tens of thousands of delegates from over a hundred countries for an artificial intelligence summit this week.
The guest list included those shaping the future of AI, such as Sam Altman of OpenAI, Sundar Pichai of Google, Dario Amodei of Anthropic and Demis Hassabis of DeepMind. Heads of state, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Brazil's Lula da Silva, along with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, also attended. 
However, even if India is not developing frontier AI models, the summit showed New Delhi wants its voice heard about the impacts of AI on developing countries and on whose terms AI is built and deployed. 

India is the first developing country to host a global AI summit, as Delhi continues to position itself as a voice for the Global South on issues shaping the world.
The first such gathering, titled the "AI Safety Summit," was held at Bletchley Park near London in November 2023, centred on existential risks. South Korea hosted the 2024 summit with a similar focus on safety.
In 2025, Paris hosted the "AI Action Summit," focusing on governance and coordination among advanced economies.
India's rendition, titled the "AI Impact Summit" emphasized "inclusive growth" and a "sustainable future."

Just days before delegates arrived in Delhi, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology directed social media platforms to take down AI-generated content that has been flagged as problematic by authorities within three hours, or two hours in cases involving sexual material.
The rules, which came into effect on Friday, reflect growing concern over AI's capacity to distort public discourse and influence democratic processes.
The immediate impact for Indians will be the new content rules that drastically reduce compliance timelines, he added. 

It will also be mandatory for platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and YouTube to clearly label what the government calls "synthetically generated information." The labels must be permanent markings that can't be suppressed or removed.
The complaint and enforcement process under the new rules remains complex and is unlikely to be easy for ordinary users to navigate. With these rules, India joins the EU, the US, China, and Australia in regulating AI-generated content. 

The conversations at the summit this week also focused on how AI can be used in the developing world, with affordable deployment, indigenous large-language models (LLMs), AI for healthcare and education.
The argument made repeatedly across sessions was that genuine AI leadership is measured not by the power of the models one builds, but by the difference they can make on the ground. 

Apar Gupta, founding director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, warned that the summit's design "treats global tech companies as equals to national governments."
This makes it normal "for AI firms to directly shape governance rules alongside states in what is framed as inclusive stakeholder engagement," Gupta told DW.
"When the event's agenda does not reflect its promises of democratization, and policy commitments rarely translate into action, the summit functions primarily as political theater rather than a venue for meaningful reform."
