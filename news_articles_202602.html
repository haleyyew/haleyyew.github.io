Temporary residents shouldn't receive full benefits, says Alberta premier  <br>
CBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Alberta Premier Danielle Smith on Friday defended proposals to limit government benefits to non-permanent residents in the province.
Smith wants to put immigration measures and constitutional questions to Albertans via a referendum that will be held on Oct. 19.
During a news conference Friday, one day after her video address to Albertans, she reiterated that the costs of benefits like health care, education and social services are a strain on government coffers.
Proposed referendum questions include asking Albertans about creating premiums and residency requirements for non-permanent residents to access social supports, and the province exerting greater control over immigration, prioritizing economic migrants. 

Earlier Friday, the Alberta Opposition NDP said the provincial government should simply call a general election, rather than hold a fall referendum that will include at least nine questions to Albertans.
"The only thing that's clear is that those nine questions are intended to be a distraction from the premier about to table a very bad budget for Albertans," NDP deputy leader Rakhi Pancholi said.
In her video address, Smith foreshadows the 2026 provincial budget, which is to be tabled next week and is expected to have a multibillion-dollar deficit. Smith said the province's financial situation is due to low oil prices, federal immigration policies and equalization payments. 

"They don't have a mandate from Albertans for this. Not on separatism, not on pulling out of the CPP, not on breaching the charter rights of thousands of Albertans, not on coal mining in the eastern slopes, and not on two-tier health-care," Pancholi said.
Pancholi called the premier's comments on immigration hypocritical, citing UCP's "Alberta is Calling campaign," designed to attract skilled workers from other provinces.

Toronto police officers accused of GPS tracking victim, orchestrating insurance fraud: court docs  <br>
CBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Adam Carter  <br>
Toronto Police Service Chief Myron Demkiw leaves after speaking about ‘Project South,’ an investigation into organized crime and corruption involving police and others, at York Regional Police headquarters in Aurora, Ont., on Feb. 5, 2026. 
Seven Toronto police officers, one retired officer and 19 civilians are facing charges after an investigation into organized crime. Police say the investigation includes a conspiracy to commit murder, shootings, extortion, robbery, drug trafficking and firearms offences. 
Last week, several police officers from Toronto were charged in a corruption probe. Three officers from the Peel region were later suspended in connection. Ontario's inspector general of policing has announced all 45 police forces in the province — and their boards — will be reviewed by an external investigator, with the findings to be made public. 

Newly released court documents reveal more details about charges laid against multiple Toronto police officers in a sweeping corruption probe — including allegations that an officer helped place a GPS tracker on a victim’s vehicle so another person could follow her.
That’s on top of accusations that a different officer arranged to have another person’s vehicle stolen so he could then file a false insurance claim. 
Seven active Toronto police officers and one retired officer have been charged in connection with the case, which has resulted in numerous charges including conspiracy to commit murder and drug trafficking. 

The documents also reveal more information about the Crown’s case against 29-year-old Const. John Madeley Jr. — who is still with Toronto police — and his father, retired constable John Madeley Sr., 55. 
The court filings say that between the beginning of 2024 up until the end of January 2026, the younger Madeley conducted “unlawful queries of police databases” and provided information to people who weren’t police officers.
That’s on top of using Toronto police’s computer systems with “intent to commit an Offence” over that same time period, according to the documents.
Court filings allege Madeley Sr. also accessed Toronto police systems in the same way as his son over that same time period — though he retired in April 2025.

Trump responds to Supreme Court loss with new 10% tariff, leaving Canada to wait for fine print  <br>
CBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
In a 6-3 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has found that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in imposing tariffs when he invoked emergency presidential powers to bring the levies into effect last year. 
Trump also took a shot at Canada and the country's auto sector in his remarks. He said the country "ripped us off for 30 per cent of our market" and claimed that Mexico has ripped the U.S. off, too.
Auto, steel and aluminum tariffs have been the most damaging to Canada's economy. Those all remain in place.
CBC News is trying to clarify if CUSMA-compliant goods will be exempt from Trump's new global tariff.

Joshua Clipperton  <br>
Nathan MacKinnon's goal with 36 seconds left in the game gave Canada a 3-2 victory over Finland, allowing them to reach the Olympic men's hockey gold-medal game. 

Sam Reinhart and Shea Theodore had the other goals for Canada, which will face either the United States or Slovakia in Sunday's podium decider to cap the NHL's return to the Games. Jordan Binnington made 15 saves.
Connor McDavid picked up two assists to set the record for points by an NHL player at a single Olympics with 13.
Mikko Rantanen and Erik Haula replied for Finland. Juuse Saros stopped 36 shots. The Finns will take on the loser of U.S.-Slovakia in Friday's late semifinal for bronze on Saturday. 

Canada was minus captain Sidney Crosby after he suffered a lower-body injury in the second period of Wednesday's thrilling 4-3 overtime victory. The 38-year-old's right leg bent in an awkward direction as he braced for a hit from defenceman Radko Gudas near centre ice.
Canadian head coach Jon Cooper said Crosby's status for Sunday's gold-medal game remains uncertain.

How Eric Dane gave his final months to 'moving the needle' on ALS  <br>
BBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Maia Davies  <br>
Dane was best known for appearing in more than 100 episodes of hospital drama Grey's Anatomy as Dr Mark Sloan, or "Dr McSteamy". 

Eric Dane, best known for starring in Grey's Anatomy, has died 10 months after confirming he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
The actor spent his final months raising funds and awareness for the rare, incurable condition - the most common form of motor-neurone disease (MND), which causes a progressive paralysis of the muscles. 
The 53-year-old shared in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with the debilitating and painful condition.
It causes the loss of cells which control voluntary muscle movements and, eventually, patients lose their ability to speak, eat, walk and breathe independently.
He helped to launch a three-year campaign in September aiming to raise more than $1bn (£742,000) in federal funding for research.

Government considers removing Andrew from royal line of succession  <br>
BBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Richard Wheeler  <br>
The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.
Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the "right thing to do," regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.
Currently Andrew, the King's brother, remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including "prince", last October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
On Thursday evening, Andrew was released under investigation 11 hours after his arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. 

At one point more than 20 vehicles could be seen parked at the property, although it is not known it all was connected to the investigation and searches.
Thames Valley Police, the force which arrested him, is expected to continue searching Royal Lodge until Monday, the BBC understands.
The government's proposal comes after some MPs, including the Liberal Democrats and SNP, signalled their support for such legislation.
Some Labour parliamentarians who have been critical of the monarchy told the BBC they were less convinced the move was required - in part because it is so unlikely the former Duke of York would ever get near to the throne.

Mountbatten-Windsor stepped back from public duties in 2019 following a backlash after an interview with BBC Newsnight about his relationship with Epstein.
Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said "all of us in public life need to give space" to the police investigation to be carried out.

Nasa targets early March to send humans back around the Moon  <br>
BBC News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Greg Brosnan  <br>
Nasa is targeting early March to launch a crew around the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, in what would be humankind's furthest trip into space.
The Artemis II mission will see four astronauts embark on a 10-day journey around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth, paving the way for a future lunar landing.
Nasa set the earliest launch date of March 6 (early on March 7 in the UK) following a successful "wet dress rehearsal" - a critical pre-launch test where the rocket is filled with fuel and taken through the countdown sequence. 

The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.
Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.

Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.
Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.
They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.
It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.
The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.
The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.

The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface.
The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.
Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.
Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.
Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.
As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.

The US could strike Iran. Here’s how Tehran is getting prepared  <br>
CNN  <br>
Feb 19, 2026  <br>

A member of the Iranian Army attends a joint naval exercise between Iran and Russia in southern Iran in this handout image obtained by Reuters on February 19. 

As the United States continues a significant military buildup in the Middle East, Iran has taken steps to signal its readiness for war, including fortifying its nuclear sites and rebuilding missile production facilities. 
Despite ongoing talks, the White House has been briefed that the US military could be ready for an attack by the weekend, after a buildup in recent days of air and naval assets in the Middle East, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
Amid the threat of war, Iran has spent recent months repairing key missile facilities and heavily damaged air bases while further concealing its nuclear program. It has appointed war veterans to its national security structures, conducted maritime wargames in the Persian Gulf and launched an intense crackdown on domestic dissent.

In June last year, Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran that destroyed parts of its nuclear program, severely damaged missile production sites and killed key military commanders. Over the ensuing 12-day conflict, Iran retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israeli cities, while the US struck three Iranian nuclear sites – with US President Donald Trump claiming they had been “totally obliterated.” 
Despite suffering heavy losses in the war with Israel, satellite imagery analysis reveals that Iran has rebuilt damaged missile facilities. 

Despite expressing flexibility in limiting its nuclear program, Iran is rapidly fortifying several of its nuclear facilities, using concrete and large amounts of soil to bury key sites, according to new satellite imagery and analysis from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS). 
At a nuclear facility known as ‘Taleghan 2’ at the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran, satellite images published this week show that Iran has completed a concrete sarcophagus around the site and is now covering it with soil, according to the Washington-based institute that focuses on nuclear nonproliferation.

Tehran has since strengthened the Supreme National Security Council headed by Khamenei confidant Ali Larijani and formed a new authority – the Defense Council – to govern in times of war.
War veteran and a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Ali Shamkhani, who survived an Israeli attempt on his life during last year’s war, was appointed this month as the secretary of the Defense Council, with the aim of “comprehensively strengthening defense preparations” and developing “mechanisms to counter emerging threats,” an outlet affiliated with Iran’s security apparatus, Nour News, said. 

Israel’s strikes on Iran in June were preceded by a sophisticated infiltration by Israel’s Mossad spy agency, a tactic that heightened the already paranoid state of the Iranian regime. 
And the regime’s deepening paranoia has even turned inward. Last week, four prominent reformists who campaigned for President Masoud Pezeshkian were detained by Iranian security forces and accused of incitement against “the internal atmosphere” and working “to destroy national cohesion by … spreading untrue positions against the country,”

Who are Donald Trump's 'kindred spirits' in Europe?  <br>
DW News  <br>
Feb 19, 2026  <br>
Christoph Hasselbach  <br>
US President Donald Trump has many enthusiastic supporters in Europe — but his plans to take over Greenland have cost him some fans. US President Donald Trump has long been able to count on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. 

Viktor Orban has been in office since 2015 and was already in power during Trump's first term (2017-2021). He sees him as a kindred spirit and in the past even referred to him as a "twin" brother. While Trump's predecessor Joe Biden said that Orban was "looking for dictatorship," the current US president has called him a "true friend, fighter and winner." 
Orban has supported Trump's plans to reduce or even stop US military aid to Ukraine, in contrast to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He has also refused to criticize Russia's war in Ukraine and has no qualms about meeting President Vladimir Putin. The Hungarian prime minister is an outsider in the European Union (EU). He has a good relationship with Germany's far-right AfD party, whose leader Alice Weidel he hosted last year. In his speech, he called her "the future of Germany." 

Slovakia: Prime Minster Fico is a contradictory figure. 
Trump sees Fico as one of his most important partners in Europe alongside Orban. The Slovakian prime minister is particularly anti-immigration and in 2016 said that "Islam has no place in Slovakia." 
But Fico's approach towards the United States has been contradictory. During his first term (2006 to 2010), he established close ties with Russia, China, Venezuela and Cuba. In late January, an article in the magazine Politico drew attention when it reported that some unnamed European diplomats had said Fico had expressed concern about the president's "psychological state" on the sidelines of a summit in Brussels.

India's AI governance push takes center stage at summit  <br>
DW News  <br>
Feb 20, 2026  <br>
Murali Krishnan  <br>
India hosted tens of tens of thousands of delegates from over a hundred countries for an artificial intelligence summit this week.
The guest list included those shaping the future of AI, such as Sam Altman of OpenAI, Sundar Pichai of Google, Dario Amodei of Anthropic and Demis Hassabis of DeepMind. Heads of state, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Brazil's Lula da Silva, along with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, also attended. 
However, even if India is not developing frontier AI models, the summit showed New Delhi wants its voice heard about the impacts of AI on developing countries and on whose terms AI is built and deployed. 

India is the first developing country to host a global AI summit, as Delhi continues to position itself as a voice for the Global South on issues shaping the world.
The first such gathering, titled the "AI Safety Summit," was held at Bletchley Park near London in November 2023, centred on existential risks. South Korea hosted the 2024 summit with a similar focus on safety.
In 2025, Paris hosted the "AI Action Summit," focusing on governance and coordination among advanced economies.
India's rendition, titled the "AI Impact Summit" emphasized "inclusive growth" and a "sustainable future."

Just days before delegates arrived in Delhi, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology directed social media platforms to take down AI-generated content that has been flagged as problematic by authorities within three hours, or two hours in cases involving sexual material.
The rules, which came into effect on Friday, reflect growing concern over AI's capacity to distort public discourse and influence democratic processes.
The immediate impact for Indians will be the new content rules that drastically reduce compliance timelines, he added. 

It will also be mandatory for platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and YouTube to clearly label what the government calls "synthetically generated information." The labels must be permanent markings that can't be suppressed or removed.
The complaint and enforcement process under the new rules remains complex and is unlikely to be easy for ordinary users to navigate. With these rules, India joins the EU, the US, China, and Australia in regulating AI-generated content. 

The conversations at the summit this week also focused on how AI can be used in the developing world, with affordable deployment, indigenous large-language models (LLMs), AI for healthcare and education.
The argument made repeatedly across sessions was that genuine AI leadership is measured not by the power of the models one builds, but by the difference they can make on the ground. 

Apar Gupta, founding director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, warned that the summit's design "treats global tech companies as equals to national governments."
This makes it normal "for AI firms to directly shape governance rules alongside states in what is framed as inclusive stakeholder engagement," Gupta told DW.
"When the event's agenda does not reflect its promises of democratization, and policy commitments rarely translate into action, the summit functions primarily as political theater rather than a venue for meaningful reform."

Exclusive: US intelligence agencies tie Chinese explosive test to push for a completely new nuclear arsenal   <br> 
CNN News    <br> 
Feb 20, 2026    <br> 
Zachary Cohen    <br> 
US intelligence agencies believe that China is developing a new generation of nuclear weapons and has conducted at least one covert explosive test in recent years as part of a broader push to completely transform its nuclear arsenal into the world’s most technologically advanced, according to multiple sources familiar with the US intelligence assessments. 

China secretly conducted an explosive nuclear test in June 2020 at the Lop Nur facility, in the country’s northwest – despite a self-imposed moratorium on such activity that has been in place since 1996 – and was planning to do more in the future, according to the sources and recent statements from US officials. While the 2020 test was disclosed publicly by US State Department officials this month, the purpose of the test has not been previously revealed. 
Evidence collected as part of a subsequent review of the June 2020 event, has led US officials to conclude the test was motivated by China’s pursuit of next-generation nuclear weapons, the sources familiar said. That includes efforts to develop additional weapons systems capable of delivering multiple, miniaturized nuclear warheads from a single missile. 

Asked about the US intelligence assessments of its nuclear program, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington told CNN that “the United States has distorted and smeared China’s nuclear policy.”
The Pentagon has previously suggested that China’s efforts to expand and improve its nuclear arsenal could “provide [China] with new options before and during a crisis or conflict to leverage nuclear weapons for coercive purposes, including military provocations against US Allies and partners in the region.”

And until recently, China’s nuclear capability was considered far less advanced than its nuclear rivals. It has conducted far fewer tests from which it could collect data needed to design modernized weapons. 
As part of that modernization push, China has been investing heavily in maneuverability and survivability, multiple sources told CNN, noting Beijing has long feared the US could potentially wipe out its entire force before it can shoot back – or at least inflict enough damage to effectively neuter it.

Two sources noted that China appeared increasingly paranoid about a potential US attack during the same timeframe as that June 2020 nuclear test. In the lead-up to the 2020 US presidential election in November of the same year, Chinese officials even reached out to then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley because they were concerned about an “October surprise,” the sources said.
While those tensions ultimately subsided, China has taken steps in the years since to not only update its nuclear forces but also sought to modernize its entire military.

Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Yeaw told an event at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington this week the June 2020 event measured an “explosion” of magnitude 2.75.
CNN has since learned that additional intelligence collected by the US after the June 2020 event served as a key piece of the puzzle as experts have argued that the seismic data is not, on it’s own, enough to definitively conclude it was a nuclear test or understand why it was carried out. 

The timing of the Trump administration’s decision to reveal details about an alleged test that took place nearly six years ago is also notable as it comes as the US is insisting China join any new nuclear arms agreement, overtures Chinese leader Xi Jinping has so far resisted, sources said.
Trump has suggested the US could resume explosive testing of its own.
Ultimately, China has more to gain from conducting explosive tests than the US, raising questions about why the State Department took the rare step of disclosing specifics about the event from June 2020 at this point, multiple sources said. 

That move suggests the Trump administration is concerned about public diplomacy with Beijing – particularly ahead of the president’s upcoming trip to the country in April, one source familiar with discussions between the two countries noted.

From Venezuela to immigration crackdown, Project 2025 provided Trump's roadmap     <br> 
BBC News     <br> 
Feb 21, 2026    <br> 
Mike Wendling     <br> 
When Donald Trump gives his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, he is expected to tout his policies from his first year back in the White House. 
Just months before he won the 2024 presidential election, Trump publicly distanced himself from Project 2025, a 900-page policy "wish list" that some believed was a detailed blueprint for his second term.
His efforts to distance himself from the document, which was published by the Heritage Foundation think-tank and laid out an ultra-conservative vision for how Trump could govern, followed a prolonged backlash from his Democratic opponents.
But now that Trump is in office, many of the ideas suggested in Project 2025 have become reality.

From a major crackdown on immigration to a renewed focus on Venezuela and the firing of thousands of federal employees, liberal groups tracking Trump's second term say around half of Project 2025 has been implemented. 
Outside experts say the document not only provided a list of ideas, but outlined legal and administrative methods to achieve them.
Those methods were front and centre during the early days of Trump's second term, when the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) made aggressive moves to cut staff and Trump moved the United States Agency for International Development under the purview of the state department.

An analysis released by a left-wing think tank, the Center for Progressive Reform, said that the White House has "already initiated or completed" 53% of the policies in the document.
A separate Project 2025 tracker using different methodology came up with roughly the same figure at 51%.
In a section on immigration, the document proposed authorising military troops to seal the country's borders, eliminating protected enforcement zones such as schools and churches, sweeping workplaces for undocumented migrants and boosting the number of detention facilities for prospective deportees.
These are all measures the Trump administration has since implemented. 

A chapter on foreign policy, which includes a section on Venezuela, stops short of calling for the removal of President Nicolás Maduro - something the Trump administration did earlier this year. 
The document also mentions three other South American countries - Colombia, Guyana, and Ecuador - which it says are "either increasingly regional security threats... or are vulnerable to hostile extra-continental powers" such as China and Russia. 

The 2025 US National Security Strategy identifies China as a leading adversary and, in a section on the Western Hemisphere, states: "The choice all countries should face is whether they want to live in an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies or in a parallel one in which they are influenced by countries on the other side of the world." 
Several contributors to Project 2025 are now inside the Trump administration, including CIA Director John Ratcliffe; Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission boss; Tom Homan, Trump's "border tsar"; Paul Atkins, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and trade adviser Peter Navarro who has championed Trump's tariffs. 

Paul Dans - who directed Project 2025 before resigning from the Heritage Foundation in August 2024 to focus on supporting Trump's election campaign – told the BBC the plan is "conservative gospel right now". 
Dans, who served in the US Office of Personnel Management during Trump's first administration, said he felt "gratified" by the number of policies in the document that have already been adopted. 
Dans added that he was acutely aware of the midterm elections and the three-and-a-bit years left in Trump's second term. "The hourglass is slowly running out, and time is being wasted," he said. 

There is also the prospect that Democrats could use sweeping executive powers, which have been expanded in part because of Project 2025, to pursue a completely different agenda if they regain the White House.
Dans, however, said he believed further adoption of Project 2025 is the future of Trump's movement.
But for liberals currently frozen out of power at the federal level, the way forward might be creating a policy document with Project 2025's vast scope, only with left-wing priorities, said James Goodwin of the Center for Progressive Reform.

Trump says sending 'great hospital boat' to Greenland    <br> 
DW News    <br> 
Feb 21, 2026    <br> 
Srinivas Mazumdaru    <br> 
The US president said a vessel was "on the way" to Greenland, with the move coming amid a rift between the US and Europe over control of the strategically important island. 
Trump said the hospital boat would treat many 'sick' people in Greenland. 

Trump did not provide any additional details about who he was referring to or the number of people the boat would help. 
Trump said in the post that he was working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry to send the hospital boat.
The US president named Landry as his envoy to Greenland in December.

Trump's post came after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a US submarine crew member who required urgent medical attention. 

Greenland, the world's largest island, is a mineral-rich, strategically important Arctic territory. It is self-governing but remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Trump says the island is crucial for US national security and that he wants to acquire it. He even threatened to seize it by force if necessary. 
The rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between Washington and its European NATO allies. 
Greenland, Denmark and the US have engaged in talks to resolve the situation.
Trump dialed back his threats after reaching a "framework" deal with NATO chief Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence over Greenland. 

Earlier this week, Denmark's King Frederik X visited Greenland.
It was his second visit to the island in a year, an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory in the face of Trump's push to acquire control of the vast island.

Giant tortoises reintroduced to a Galapagos island     <br> 
DW News     <br> 
Feb 21, 2026    <br> 
Louis Oelofse     <br> 
Ecuador released 158 juveniles in the first phase of an ambitious rewilding effort at the World Heritage Site. 
The newcomers have begun exploring the habitat they are destined to reshape over the coming years. 
Authorities say the tortoises are large enough to survive in the wild and withstand predators. 

Nearly 150 years after giant tortoises vanished from Floreana Island in Ecuador's Galapagos archipelago, the species has made a long‑anticipated return. 
The young tortoises carry between 40% and 80% of the genetic makeup of "Chelonoidis niger," the species that disappeared in the 19th century due to invasive mammals, whaling, fire and human exploitation.
According to the ministry, the juveniles were bred at a Galapagos National Park facility using animals with strong genetic ties to Floreana's lost lineage. Officials hope the long‑term resettlement effort will eventually restore the original species profile on the island. 
National Geographic identifies 13 living species of Galapagos tortoises on other islands in the archipelago. Adults can weigh more than 250 kilograms (550 pounds), and the oldest known individual lived to age 175. 

Officials say the timing of the release is favorable, with seasonal rains creating conditions that will help the tortoises adjust to their new environment.
The tortoises will now share Floreana with a small human population and a diverse range of native wildlife. They will also face threats from invasive species, which conservationists say remain a major challenge.
Floreana resident Veronica Mora said seeing the tortoises return was deeply meaningful for the community.

Researchers are also working to bring back 12 additional endemic species to Floreana as part of a wide‑scale rewilding initiative.
The Galapagos Islands, a World Heritage Site, lie about 1,000 kilometers off Ecuador's coast and are known for their unique biodiversity.

China's Eileen Gu wins gold in women's Olympic halfpipe final, Canadian Amy Fraser 4th  <br> 
CBC News  <br> 
The Associated Press  <br> 
Feb 22, 2026  <br> 
Eileen Gu defended her Olympic ski halfpipe title on Sunday to make it six medals in six events over her Winter Games career.
The 22-year-old Gu, American-born but competing for her mother's homeland of China, is already the most decorated freeskier in the short history of the sport at the Olympics. She also captured two silver medals at Milano-Cortina, to pair with two golds and a silver from the Beijing Games. 
Gu won the event on the strength of her second run, a clean, technically sound pass. She got even better in her final run — pumping her ski poles after landing the final trick — and finished with a score of 94.75. Her teammate, Li Fanghui, took silver and Zoe Atkin of Britain was third. 

Cassie Sharpe, of Comox, B.C., suffered a concussion during a crash in qualifying on Thursday. The 2018 Olympic champion and Beijing 2022 silver medallist was not medically cleared for the final. 

The event was rescheduled to Sunday following a big snowstorm the night before. It was a bright, sunny day as Gu shined in the final event at the Livigno Snow Park. She shielded her eyes from the sun to catch a peek of her winning score — and instantly liked what she saw. 
Atkin, an American-born skier who competes for her father's homeland of Britain, soared high all contest, a staggering 5.4 metres above the pipe at one point. She finished ninth at the Beijing Games but has been a steady presence on World Cup podiums ever since. She has three victories over the last four years, all in events where Gu didn't compete. The 23-year-old Atkin is the defending world champion.

Armed man shot and killed after entering perimeter around Trump’s Florida home   <br> 
CNN   <br> 
Feb 22, 2026  <br> 
John Miller  <br>  
US Secret Service agents and Palm Beach County law enforcement shot and killed an armed man who unlawfully entered the secure perimeter at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida on Sunday morning, the Secret Service said. 
The incident comes amid a backdrop of heightened political violence in the US. In July 2024, Trump survived an assassination attempt while campaigning for his second term in Pennsylvania. Another man who planned to assassinate the president at his Florida golf course in September 2024 was sentenced this month to life in prison. 

A White man in his early 20s entered the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago around 1:30 a.m. ET before he was shot by agents and a deputy with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, authorities said. The man appeared to be carrying a shotgun and a fuel can, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday.
The man entered Mar-a-Lago through the north gate as an employee was walking out. He made it about 20 or 30 yards before he was confronted by law enforcement, officials said. 
The man is from North Carolina and was reported missing Saturday by his mother, law enforcement officials said. His name is being withheld until his family is notified of his death.
The FBI is leading the investigation, with teams collecting evidence and looking into his background and motive. 
The agency is asking residents in the area of the shooting to check their exterior cameras and contact authorities if they notice anything suspicious. 

Trump spends most weekends during the winter at his Mar-a-Lago club. He is spending this weekend in Washington, where he hosted a dinner for governors at the White House on Saturday night.
As Mar-a-Lago has increasingly become the setting for official presidential activity under Trump, security has been a concern for intelligence officials. While the Secret Service screens guests before they enter, it does not determine who can access the site, as paying club members may enter alongside world leaders. 

Recent security enhancements include snipers, bomb-sniffing dogs and boats patrolling the Intracoastal Waterway, along with miles of secure telephone and internet cables.

Trump curious why Iran has not 'capitulated', US envoy Witkoff says   <br> 
BBC News   <br> 
Feb 22, 2026  <br> 
Jaroslav Lukiv   <br> 
US President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not yet "capitulated" in the face of Washington's military build-up in the Middle East, the US president's special envoy Steve Witkoff has said. 
The US and its European allies suspect Iran of moving towards making a nuclear weapon, which it denies. 
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he believed there was still a chance that the dispute could be solved diplomatically "based on a win-win game". 
On Friday, Araghchi said Tehran was preparing "a draft of a possible agreement" and would hand it over to Witkoff in the next few days. 
Despite this, Trump said two days later the world would find out "over the next, probably, 10 days" whether a deal with Iran would be reached or the US would take military action. 

The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.
USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier has also been deployed, along with destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets. 

In Iran, the BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. They were later seen scuffling with government supporters. 
Iranian media reported demonstrations also took place on Sunday at the Iran University of Science and Technology and Khajeh Nasir Toosi University in Tehran, and at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in north-eastern Iran. 
Another verified video shows a pro-government crowd holding a counter-protest at the Sharif University in which US and Israeli flags are being burned.
Clashes between pro and anti-government crowds are also seen in verified footage filmed at Amirkabir University of Technology. 

President Trump has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that "help is on its way".

European Commission urges US to honor trade deal  <br> 
DW News   <br> 
Feb 22, 2026  <br> 
The EU's executive insisted that "a deal is a deal" after US President Donald Trump said he was raising a global 10% tariff to 15% in response to the US Supreme Court blocking many of his emergency tariffs. 

The court decision has cast uncertainty over the ratification of the deal, which had been put on hold and was to be approved by the European Parliament on Tuesday. 
In an earlier statement issued on Friday, the Commission said it was studying the potential effects of the court's decision. 

Trump imposed tariffs on multiple countries shortly after he took office in January 2025, in a bid to reduce the US trade deficit and boost manufacturing in the country.
In July 2025, Trump threatened to impose a 30% tariff on all EU goods.
After negotiations between Brussels and Washington, the two sides reached a deal setting tariffs of 15% on most EU exports to the US. It would also require the EU to buy $750 billion (€636.5 billion) of US energy products through 2028.

Eby says Tumbler Ridge shooting could have potentially been prevented if OpenAI warned authorities earlier   <br> 
CBC News   <br> 
Feb 23, 2026  <br> 
Emily Fagan   <br> 
B.C. Premier David Eby called on OpenAI to share information on what it knew about the Tumbler Ridge shooter’s violent online activity, and why the U.S.-based company did not alert authorities prior to one of the worst shootings in Canadian history.
If the American company does not come forward with the information, which it has shared with the RCMP, Eby said that British Columbians will find out anyway — either through a coroner’s inquest or a public inquiry. 

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, said in a statement that the account’s activity was not determined to meet the threshold for alerting law enforcement, but that the company reached out to law enforcement following the shooting. 
The story about Van Rootselaar's ChatGPT account was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Canada’s artificial intelligence minister, Evan Solomon, will meet with OpenAI’s senior safety team in Ottawa tomorrow. 
He did not say if the government is considering legislation to better regulate AI companies, but said “all options are on the table.”

Lord Mandelson arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office   <br> 
BBC News   <br> 
Feb 23, 2026  <br> 
Olivia Ireland   <br> 
Lord Mandelson has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The Metropolitan Police said a 72-year-old man was arrested at an address in Camden, north London, on Monday and taken to a police station for interview.
The arrest follows search warrants at two addresses in the Wiltshire and Camden, a police statement added.
The force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a government minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.
The government has said it expects to release the first documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment in "early March".
The BBC understands his arrest was carried out by officers from the Met's central specialist crime division. 
Consultations between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing. 

An email from 2009 appears to show that Lord Mandelson passed on an assessment by an adviser to the then prime minister Gordon Brown about policy measures, including an "asset sales plan".
He also appeared to discuss a tax on bankers' bonuses and confirm an imminent bailout package for the Euro on the day before it was announced in 2010. 
BBC News understands the government will continue talking to police about which documents can be released, after it was previously suggested an arrest could have implications for that process. 

The government still wants to be able to publish documents, which it hopes will back up Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Lord Mandelson had "lied" during his vetting process. 
He began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.

How Mexico hunted ‘El Mencho’ with help from his lover’s ‘trusted man’ and US intelligence   <br> 
CNN   <br> 
Feb 23, 2026  <br> 
Mauricio Torres   <br> 
A soldier stands guard by a charred vehicle after it was set on fire, in Cointzio, Michoacán state, Mexico, on Sunday, following the death of the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera, known as "El Mencho." 

Oseguera was the leader and co-founder of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a criminal group that has rapidly expanded its influence in recent years, becoming one of the main traffickers of methamphetamine and fentanyl into the US. 

It also comes just months before the Mexican city of Guadalajara – which was rocked by violence following the drug lord’s capture – is set to host four group-stage matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

After years of pursuing Oseguera, Mexican forces on February 20 received a concrete tip about the feared cartel leader’s whereabouts.
Their investigation into Oseguera’s network had led them to a key person who could help access his hideout – a “trusted man” of one of Oseguera’s lovers, according to Mexican Defense Secretary Ricardo Trevilla Trejo. 
To avoid arousing suspicion, the mission was primarily carried out by ground forces with limited air support from helicopters, Trevilla said. 
The Mexican troops established a perimeter around the complex and then closed in. As they did so, they came under fire from Oseguera’s lieutenants. 

Cabañas La Loma was sanctioned by the US Treasury in 2015 and again in 2017 for providing “material assistance to the drug trafficking activities of (the Jalisco cartel).” 
The exchange of fire killed eight cartel members and wounded two soldiers, Trevilla said. 
After a further firefight, the Special Forces team captured the cartel leader and two of his bodyguards. All three had been seriously wounded and it was determined that they would need to be evacuated if they were to survive, Trevilla said. 
Amid the chaos, 25 members of the National Guard military police were killed. 

It may be that the opportunity to capture Oseguera – a man who the US has classified as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist with a $15 million bounty on his head – was simply too good to pass up. 
Knowing that the retaliatory violence was likely to occur, the government determined that it had the capacity to “contain the disruption and maintain governance and restore it in a short period,” Vargas said. 

David Mora, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the drug lord’s death might weaken the Jalisco cartel and open “the possibility of further violence within the group” – while also presenting other cartels with an opportunity to encroach on the Jalisco cartel’s territory.

Ukraine updates: Russian invasion reaches 4-year anniversary   <br> 
DW News   <br> 
Feb 23, 2026  <br> 
Alex Berry  <br> 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted up a message of support for Ukraine as Russia's full-scale invasion reached the four-year mark. 
It was accompanied with a photo of the Commission's headquarters in Brussels with a large national flag of Ukraine projected onto the building. 

Russian authorities say explosive detonated near train station in Moscow. 
Russia's Interior Ministry said that a man detonated an explosive device next to a police car in central Moscow, killing both himself and a police officer and injuring two others.
The ministry said the attack took place at about 12:05 am (2105 GMT) on Savyolovsky railway station square. 

Europe has the power but not the political will, Ben Hodges tells DW. 
Four years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the war is far from over — and its outcome remains uncertain.
In an exclusive interview, DW asked retired US General Ben Hodges what went wrong and what's next. 

Russia's war in Ukraine: 4 years in numbers. 
Reliable figures for casualties and death tolls from the war in Ukraine are notoriously difficult to come by, but four years of conflict have provided enough material for estimations. Here are some of the key figures from the war: 
1.2 million casualties, including 325,000 deaths on the Russian side between February 2022 and December 2025, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
500,000-600,000 casualties, including 140,000 deaths on the Ukrainian side during the same period. 
Russia controls 19.4% of Ukrainian land, according to the Institute for the Study of War, up from 7% before February 2022. 
Russian forces only gained 0.79% of Ukrainian territory last year amid a grinding war of attrition. 
5.9 million Ukrainians have left their country, the vast majority headed to Europe, 3.7 million have been displaced within Ukraine.

State of the union: Shouting match breaks out in chamber as Trump defends U.S. immigration policy   <br> 
CBC News   <br> 
Feb 24, 2026  <br> 
U.S. President Donald Trump is delivering his state of the union address tonight, trying to make the case that the economy has improved drastically since he took office last year.
Trump described the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that invalidated his tariff policy as "very unfortunate" and said he would seek to use other laws to implement the levies.
Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib shouted at Trump as he defended his immigration policies.
Earlier in his speech, Trump went on an extended tangent about hockey after praising members of the U.S. men's team that recently beat Canada for gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics.

Dozens of FBI records apparently missing from Epstein files, including Trump accuser interviews  <br> 
CNN  <br> 
Feb 24, 2026  <br> 
Casey Tolan  <br> 
Dozens of FBI witness interviews from the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein appear to be missing from the massive trove of files released by the Department of Justice last month, according to a CNN review – including three interviews related to a woman who accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her decades ago.
An evidence log provided to attorneys for Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell includes serial numbers for about 325 FBI witness interview records – but more than 90 of those records, over a quarter of the list, don’t appear to be present on the DOJ website, according to CNN’s review. 
Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In a statement, the White House called the allegations against Trump “false and sensationalist” and pointed to a previous DOJ statement that “some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump.”
Details about the missing documents related to the Trump accuser were previously reported by NPR and independent journalist Roger Sollenberger. 

Many documents have also been removed and added back to the DOJ’s Epstein files website over the weeks since the initial release. Last week, CNN’s analysis found that about a dozen additional interview reports were also missing, but those were available online as of Tuesday afternoon. One of the two evidence logs was also offline last week but is now accessible again. The DOJ spokesperson said that it was “temporarily removed for victim redactions.” 

Buried in the more than 3 million pages of files released by the DOJ is a set of documents that federal prosecutors provided to attorneys for Maxwell in advance of her 2021 sex trafficking trial.
Those records include hundreds of FBI memos known as “302” files that document interviews, as well as other materials related to dozens of witnesses, some of whom testified at the trial, according to two evidence logs included in the DOJ release. 
Experts said they were concerned about the apparently missing 302s because they are key to understanding the FBI’s yearslong investigation into Epstein and Maxwell. Typically, 302s lay out what an interviewee told agents, but don’t include other corroborating information or agents’ opinions. 
Details about most of the missing 302 documents, including the identity of the people interviewed, are largely redacted from the evidence logs. 

At least one Epstein victim has complained to a court that the DOJ hasn’t complied with providing full transparency and accountability in its release of the files.
The victim, Haley Robson, wrote to a federal judge last month questioning why victim interview reports and other documents haven’t been published with victim names redacted.

Political outsiders are up against Thailand's powerful patronage system, defeated MP tells BBC   <br> 
BBC News   <br> 
Feb 24, 2026  <br> 
Jonathan Head   <br> 
Chutiphong Pipoppinyo was part of the "orange wave" of idealistic young candidates who stunned Thailand in the 2023 election by winning more seats for the progressive Move Forward party than any other party.
This year though, he lost his seat in his home province of Rayong to a rival from an old established family which has traditionally occupied positions of power there.
Now renamed the People's Party, their hopes that they would improve on their 2023 performance were dashed on the rocks of the old-style patronage networks which have dominated provincial politics in Thailand throughout its modern history. 
The results are not yet official, and a number of election irregularities are being investigated, but that won't change the overall outcome: a steep drop of more than 20% in the number of seats won by the People's Party, and a remarkable surge by the conservative Bhumjaithai party, increasing its share of seats from 71 in 2023 to an estimated 193 in the 500-seat parliament this year. 

After winning his seat in 2023, Chutiphong threw himself into his new job, travelling around his constituency hoping to help solve the problems faced by his neighbours. But he quickly encountered resistance from those working for the established power-brokers. Worse still, he found he was expected to donate generously, from funds he simply did not have. 
Rayong is best known as part of the Eastern Economic Corridor, Thailand's largest industrial zone, hosting many of the factories which drive its export-dependent economy. This has brought in migrant workers from other regions, and also created an urban middle class which is more responsive to the reformist ideas of the progressive movement.
In 2023 Move Forward won all five constituencies there. 

The young MPs of the People's Party lacked social capital, he says. Their faces might be familiar on social media, but they lacked the recognition and trust enjoyed by established power brokers in the villagers. 
But the ease with which the courts and other conservative institutions blocked Move Forward from forming a government after their win in 2023 left many Thais cynical about the possibilities for change, and more focussed on more immediate economic challenges.

Louvre Museum's director resigns after October jewel heist   <br> 
DW News   <br> 
Feb 24, 2026  <br> 
Roshni Majumdar   <br> 
French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday accepted the resignation of the Louvre Museum's director, Laurence des Cars.
She's been under fire ever since thieves stole a stash of priceless jewelry from the museum in a brazen daytime heist last year.
Macron's office announced Des Cars's resignation in a statement and also praised the move as an "act of responsibility at a time when the world's largest museum needs calm and a strong new impetus to carry out major projects involving security upgrades, modernization" and other initiatives.
Des Cars was named director of the Louvre, one of the museum world's most prestigious jobs, in 2021. 

The world's most visited museum, with guest footfall levels of up to 9 million a year, is still reeling from the heist that took place on October 19 during broad daylight.
A group of robbers broke in through a window, equipped with power tools like a disc cutter, and stole French crown jewels worth €88 million, or around $102 million.
A crane lift mounted on a truck waited outside a window and was brought in to aid with the raid, which took place around 9:30 a.m. when the museum was still opening.
People have been arrested over the course of investigation, but the jewels, once worn by France's queens and empresses, have yet to be returned to authorities. 

The Louvre is a historically important museum intertwined with the makings of French society itself.
The museum was a royal palace and was opened to the public during the French Revolution. It houses the Mona Lisa, the world's most famous artwork.
France's chief architect of historical monuments told the Associated Press in an interview last year that many museums, especially in Europe, are in historic buildings that were not constructed with the goal of securing art.
Des Cars acknowledged last year that the museum had a shortage of security cameras outside the monument and other weaknesses that were exposed during the weekend theft.

A Chinese official’s use of ChatGPT accidentally revealed a global intimidation operation   <br> 
CNN   <br> 
Feb 25, 2026  <br> 
Sean Lyngaas   <br> 
The Chinese law enforcement official used ChatGPT like a diary to document the alleged covert campaign of suppression, OpenAI said. In one instance, Chinese operators allegedly disguised themselves as US immigration officials to warn a US-based Chinese dissident that their public statements had supposedly broken the law, according to the ChatGPT user. In another case, they describe an effort to use forged documents from a US county court to try to get a Chinese dissident’s social media account taken down. 
The report offers one of the most vivid examples yet of how authoritarian regimes can use AI tools to document their censorship efforts. The influence operation appeared to involve hundreds of Chinese operators and thousands of fake online accounts on various social media platforms, according to OpenAI. 

OpenAI’s investigators were able to match descriptions from the ChatGPT user with real-world online activity and impact. The user described an effort to fake the death of a Chinese dissident by creating a phony obituary and photos of a gravestone and posting them online. False rumors of the dissident’s death did indeed surfaced online in 2023, according to a Chinese-language Voice of America article. 
The report comes amid a battle between the US and China for supremacy over AI. At stake is how the technology is used on the battlefield and in the boardroom of the world’s two biggest economies.

Bill Gates 'took responsibility' over Epstein ties in staff meeting, foundation says  <br>  
BBC News   <br> 
Feb 25, 2026  <br> 
Ben Hatton   <br> 
The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Gates apologised to staff, said he had two affairs with Russian women which Epstein later found out about, and in relation to the late financier said: "I did nothing illicit. I saw nothing illicit."
Gates has come under renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein following the release of files by the US Department of Justice in January. 
The Microsoft co-founder, 70, has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims. 

Gates told the foundation's staff he met Epstein in 2011 - years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution - adding that he said he was aware of some "18-month thing" that had limited Epstein's travel, but that he didn't properly check his background, according to the report.
He continued to meet Epstein through 2014, and spent time with him abroad, he reportedly said, adding that he "never stayed overnight" or visited Epstein's island.
The relationship continued even after his ex-wife expressed doubts, he is reported to have said, adding: "To give her credit, she was always kind of sceptical about the Epstein thing."

Gates established his philanthropic organisation alongside his then wife, Melinda French Gates. They divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.
In an interview with an NPR podcast earlier this month she said the latest release of files dredged up "painful times in my marriage". 
US media have reported that before their separation Melinda had been upset about her husband's association with Epstein. After their split was announced, Bill Gates acknowledged having had an affair with a Microsoft employee in 2019.
In his reported remarks to staff on Tuesday, Gates said he met the two women with whom he said he had affairs with through his own social and business activities. 
It follows claims made in emails drafted by Epstein in July 2013, and contained in the files released in January, that Gates contracted a sexually transmitted infection and tried to hide it, including from his then-wife Melinda. 
One draft email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates "in order to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls".
